The DevOps Pipeline
In this Learning Activity, you will create a DevOps pipeline all the way from making a code change to deploying that change to a production environment. One of the great benefits of DevOps comes from its focus on automated pipelines, and here you will have the opportunity to try one out so that you can see it in action from a hands-on perspective.

After completing this Learning Activity, you should have a basic idea of what it is like to use a DevOps pipeline to change the code and get those changes into production.

This is a simple sample application intended to be used alongside the labs for DevOps Essentials.
